# SYNA - Virtual AI Assistant for PDF Interaction

## 📌 Overview
SYNA is a **virtual AI assistant** designed to interact with PDF documents using a **local Large Language Model (LLM)**. It helps users by reading, summarizing, and answering queries related to the PDF, thereby optimizing time and improving document comprehension. The project utilizes **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to extract and process relevant information from PDFs efficiently.

## 🔥 Features
- 🗂 **Direct PDF Interaction** – Query PDFs without manual reading.
- 🧠 **Local LLM-powered processing** – Works offline with a local AI model.
- 📖 **Summarization** – Generates concise summaries of lengthy documents.
- 🔍 **Information Retrieval (RAG)** – Fetches relevant sections dynamically.
- ⏳ **Time-efficient** – Helps users quickly extract key insights.

## 🚀 Installation
### Prerequisites
